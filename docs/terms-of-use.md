# Terms of Use
**Effective date:** 2025-12-21

By installing or using AdamAppLock (“the App”), you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Use of the App
The App helps you restrict access to selected apps on your device. You must use it in compliance with applicable laws and platform policies.

## 2. Permissions
The App requires certain Android permissions (Display over other apps, Usage access, Unrestricted background usage) to function correctly. If you do not grant or maintain these permissions, protection may not work.

## 3. Your responsibilities
- Choose a strong passcode and keep it confidential.
- Keep your device updated and secure.
- Understand that disabling system security features or removing required permissions can reduce protection.

## 4. Data & privacy
The App is designed to operate on-device and does not send personal data to remote servers. See the **[Privacy Policy](/privacy/)** for details.

## 5. Open-source components
The App may include open-source libraries under their respective licenses. Notices are available in the repository.

## 6. Disclaimer of warranties
The App is provided **“as is”** without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation, or that the App will prevent all unauthorized access.

## 7. Limitation of liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.

## 8. Changes
We may update these Terms. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.

## 9. Termination
We may suspend or end your access if you violate these Terms or misuse the App.
